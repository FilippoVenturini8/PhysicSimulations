This project contains simulations of different physical behaviors implemented in four different scenes.

## 📏 Projectile Simulation

</p>

In this simulation, a projectile trajectory is simulated and compared to the analytic one, using different types of integrators such as `Euler`, `Symplectic Euler`, `Verlet`, and `RK2`.

## ⚛ Particle System

</p>

In this simulation, a `particle system` is implemented to handle an arbitrary number of particles emitted by a fountain. Different types of `collisions` are handled, with the floor, a cube, and a movable sphere. Each particle is subjected to the `gravitational force` and, if activated, to the gravitational force of a `black hole`.

## 🧣 Cloth Simulation

</p>

In this part, cloth behavior is simulated by adding spring forces between particles following `Provot's Layout`.

## 🌊 Fluid Simulation

</p>

In this last part, a fluid simulation is realized by implementing the `Navier-Stokes` equations and following the `SPH Loop`.
