# Physic Simulations
This project containts a simulation of different physic behaviours implemented in four different scenes.

## Projectile simulation

In this simulation a projectile trajectory is simulated and compared to the analytic one, using different types of integrator such as Euler, Symplectic Euler, Verlet and RK2.

## Particle System

In this simulation a particle system is implemented for handle an arbitrary number of particle that are emitted by a fountain. Different types of collisions are handled, jwith the floor, a cube and a movable sphere. Each particle is subjected to the gravity force and if activated, to the gravidational force of a black hole.

## Cloth simulation

In this part a cloth behaviour is simulated by adding between particles some spring forces following the Provot's Layout.

## Fluid simulation

In this last part a fluid simulation is realized by implementing the Navier-Stokes equations and following the SPH Loop.
